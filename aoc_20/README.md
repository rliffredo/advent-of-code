## Day 1: Report Repair

I actually forgot about AoC, this year, so I started it late.

So, today's task was quite a typical interview coding task, with just some story
about Christmas (small OT: I really hope we are going to save Santa again!).  
This was one I was fully prepared, having done it countless times; but I suspect
that the second part, without an efficient first part, could have taken a bit
too much time.
