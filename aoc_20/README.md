## Day 1: Report Repair

I actually forgot about AoC, this year, so I started it late.

So, today's task was quite a typical interview coding task, with just some story
about Christmas (small OT: I really hope we are going to save Santa again!).  
This was one I was fully prepared, having done it countless times; but I suspect
that the second part, without an efficient first part, could have taken a bit
too much time.

## Day 2: Password Philosophy

Again, a simple one. We are just in the early phases of the game :)
I am not very happy with the solution, but it worked at the first try.

This time I am using less ipython, and more python with type hinting. I am not
sure if this is not removing the fun of the thing, or it's just that I got used
to it. But I also appreciate taking it a bit slower, and going in a simpler
and steadier way.
